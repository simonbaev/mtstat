    The SCORE is computed using the formula 4C - I + 40, where C represents
the number of correct responses and I represents the number of incorrect
responses.  Incomplete erasures and multiple marks are scored as incorrect
responses.  Blank responses do not affect the score.  The table below shows
only the score and the number correct.  If you desire the number incorrect
and the number left blank, you will have to deduce them from the scoring
formula.

    We enjoyed having you as part of our activities today and hope that you
found this to be a rewarding learning experience.  We look forward to seeing
you at Georgia Southwestern at our other competitions and visitations during
the year.

    The SCORE is computed using the formula 4C - I + 40, where C represents
the number of correct responses and I represents the number of incorrect
responses.  Incomplete erasures and multiple marks are scored as incorrect
responses.  Blank responses do not affect the score.  The table below shows
only the score and the number correct.  If you desire the number incorrect
and the number left blank, you will have to deduce them from the scoring
formula.

    The SCORE is computed using the formula 4C - I + 40, where C represents
the number of correct responses and I represents the number of incorrect
responses.  Incomplete erasures and multiple marks are scored as incorrect
responses.  Blank responses do not affect the score.  The table below shows
only the score and the number correct.  If you desire the number incorrect
and the number left blank, you will have to deduce them from the scoring
formula.

    The SCORE is computed using the formula 4C - I + 40, where C represents
the number of correct responses and I represents the number of incorrect
responses.  Incomplete erasures and multiple marks are scored as incorrect
responses.  Blank responses do not affect the score.  The table below shows
only the score and the number correct.  If you desire the number incorrect
and the number left blank, you will have to deduce them from the scoring
formula.

    We enjoyed having you as part of our activities today and hope that you
found this to be a rewarding learning experience.  We look forward to seeing
you at Georgia Southwestern at our other competitions and visitations during

    The SCORE is computed using the formula 4C - I + 40, where C represents
the number of correct responses and I represents the number of incorrect
responses.  Incomplete erasures and multiple marks are scored as incorrect
responses.  Blank responses do not affect the score.  The table below shows
only the score and the number correct.  If you desire the number incorrect
and the number left blank, you will have to deduce them from the scoring
formula.

    We enjoyed having you as part of our activities today and hope that you
found this to be a rewarding learning experience.  We look forward to seeing
you at Georgia Southwestern at our other competitions and visitations during
the year.

    The SCORE is computed using the formula 4C - I + 40, where C represents
the number of correct responses and I represents the number of incorrect
responses.  Incomplete erasures and multiple marks are scored as incorrect
responses.  Blank responses do not affect the score.  The table below shows
only the score and the number correct.  If you desire the number incorrect
and the number left blank, you will have to deduce them from the scoring
formula.

    We enjoyed having you as part of our activities today and hope that you
found this to be a rewarding learning experience.  We look forward to seeing
you at Georgia Southwestern at our other competitions and visitations during
the year.

    The SCORE is computed using the formula 4C - I + 40, where C represents
the number of correct responses and I represents the number of incorrect
responses.  Incomplete erasures and multiple marks are scored as incorrect
responses.  Blank responses do not affect the score.  The table below shows
only the score and the number correct.  If you desire the number incorrect
and the number left blank, you will have to deduce them from the scoring
formula.

    The SCORE is computed using the formula 4C - I + 40, where C represents
the number of correct responses and I represents the number of incorrect
responses.  Incomplete erasures and multiple marks are scored as incorrect
responses.  Blank responses do not affect the score.  The table below shows
only the score and the number correct.  If you desire the number incorrect
and the number left blank, you will have to deduce them from the scoring
formula.

    We enjoyed having you as part of our activities today and hope that you
found this to be a rewarding learning experience.  We look forward to seeing
you at Georgia Southwestern at our other competitions and visitations during

    The SCORE is computed using the formula 4C - I + 40, where C represents
the number of correct responses and I represents the number of incorrect
responses.  Incomplete erasures and multiple marks are scored as incorrect
responses.  Blank responses do not affect the score.  The table below shows
only the score and the number correct.  If you desire the number incorrect
and the number left blank, you will have to deduce them from the scoring
formula.

    We enjoyed having you as part of our activities today and hope that you
found this to be a rewarding learning experience.  We look forward to seeing
you at Georgia Southwestern at our other competitions and visitations during
the year.

    The SCORE is computed using the formula 4C - I + 40, where C represents
the number of correct responses and I represents the number of incorrect
responses.  Incomplete erasures and multiple marks are scored as incorrect
responses.  Blank responses do not affect the score.  The table below shows
only the score and the number correct.  If you desire the number incorrect
and the number left blank, you will have to deduce them from the scoring
formula.

    We enjoyed having you as part of our activities today and hope that you
found this to be a rewarding learning experience.  We look forward to seeing
you at Georgia Southwestern at our other competitions and visitations during
the year.
